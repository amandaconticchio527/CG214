        <h1>Welcome!!</H1>
            My name is <I>Amanda Conticchio</I>
            <p> I am a 20 year old Fine artist. I enjoy drawing and painting the most. I started doing art in the 5th grade and loved it ever since.</p>
         <h2> Family</h2>
        <p> I live in the bronx in country club. I have a 18 year old brother. He just started his first semster at hostos Community college.  
            My mom and dad are wonderful parents who try to give me everything I need. Sometimes things are tough but I will always love them. </p>
 <p> I can`t forget about my cat, Oreo. We had her for 5 years now and she`s just part of our family now.</p>
        I want to travel the world. The top on my list is Italy. It`s sad to say I am fully Italian and never been to Italy. I hope to get a good job when I finish my masters and live a happy life.
