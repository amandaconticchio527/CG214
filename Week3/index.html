     <h2> <i> Biography of Pollock </i></h2>
     <p> Pollock was an american abstract painter. He was known for his very loose drip techniques. He died in 1956, but is still commonly talked  about</p>
     <h3> What does Pollock do while painting? </h3>
     <ul>
     <li> Puts the canvas on the floor</li>
    <li> Puts music on (sometimes) to get him in the    mood</li> 
         <li> Gets his paint and brushes and begins working</li>
         <li> Mixes the colors he wants ahead of time</li>
         <li> Gets all into his art, very loose even steping on the canvas</li>
         <li> Works fast so the paint doesn`t dry up on him</li>
     </ul>

        <p> The image below on the left was an Abstract piece I did in my class last year. As you can tell I was looking at Pollock during the time I was making it. </p>
        <p> I wanted to see how it felt to make art on the ground instead of on an easel. It was fun, I moved around a lot and let my arms free.</p>
        <p> He is an influential artist to me because even though it seems so simple what he did, it really isn`t. There is a lot of thought behind it and from my own experience that can be really difficult.</p>
