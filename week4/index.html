         <h2> Reasons why I enjoy this site! </h2>
         
         <ul>
             <li> Very Interactive </li>
             <li> Super easy to use </li>
             <li> Colorful and fun for kids </li>
             <li> The site is unusual, which I think makes it more fun to explore </li>  
         </ul>
         
         <p> I put the video below because it reminds me of the image on the left. If your on the site and click on staggering beauty it brings you to this movable worm looking thing. </p>            
         <p>  This one as well is interactive and moves when you move your mouse. </p>
         <p> The video that I put has similar aspects of this worm and makes me laugh. It`s a silly image </p>
